In Basra, a designer and his wife happened upon an entertaining hunchback who they chose to welcome to their home for supper. While the hunchback was eating and kidding, he got choked by a sharp fishbone. 


The two enveloped the dead man with various things and imagined he was a kid with smallpox so everybody would let them be. The two left the hunchback at the doctor's home and took off. The doctor was anxious to see his patient, and he stumbled down the steps, falling onto the hunchback. Accepting he killed a patient, the doctor pawns the dead body off on his neighbour.
